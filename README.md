# UIUC CS498 Spring 2020: Audio Labaratory Assignments

### Introduction

- This course covers the basic ideas of audio processing and wide range of techniques to create sound effects.

- Courses and assignments are designed by Professor Paris Smaragdis.

### Contents

- **W1**: Basic Sound Manipulation
    
    - Generate tones and basic sounds such as chirp, ping-pong, etc.
    - In/output sounds from/to storage or sound devices

- **W2**: Time and Frequency Domain

    - Conduct Short Time Fourier Transform and generate spectrograms
    - Blocking some noises in Frequency Domain and transform back to sound data in time domain.

- **W3**: Fix Sounds with Filters

    - Design Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Bandstop filters with different techniques and apply on different type of noises.

- **W4**: Reverberation and Room Simulation

    - Generate reverb effects by designing Comb filters, Allpass filters, etc.
    - Create the room's response via deconvolution and apply to the sounds.
