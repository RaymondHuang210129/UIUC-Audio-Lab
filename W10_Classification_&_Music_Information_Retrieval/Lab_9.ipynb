    "In this section we will design a simple classifier that will let us know if its input is speech or non-speech. Download the data archive from: [ https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAnvk-hzzgzZ4di4W0pKw6v3IWLm9u2X/view?usp=sharing ] In this part we will use the dataset in data/SpeechMusic. In it you will find two directories, speech/ and music/ containing data from each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly select 50 soundfiles from each directory to use as training data, and use the remaining sounds as testing data. For all of the sounds we will compute a representation that makes the classification easier and we will use a simple Gaussian model to classify them. Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform an STFT for each sound, take itâ€™s magnitude and raise it to 0.3 to improve contrast\n",
    "    - We will consider each spctral slice of that to be a data point\n",
    "- Using the training data of each sound:\n",
    "    - Calculate the mean column and the diagonal covariance of the columns\n",
    "    - You will thus get two sets of Gaussian parameters that model each sound class\n",
    "- For each testing data point:\n",
    "    - Calculate the likelihood of each column based on the above models\n",
    "\t- To calculate the entire file likelihood add all the frame likelihoods\n",
    "\t- Assign each soundfile to the class that gets the highest likelihood\n",
